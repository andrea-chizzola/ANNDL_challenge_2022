# ANNDL_challenge_2022

## Image Classification

In this first challenge we were required to classify species of plants which are divided into categories according to the species to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal was to predict the correct class label.

Dataset Details:

    Image size: 96x96
    Color space: RGB 
    File Format: JPG
    Number of classes: 8
    Classes:
        0: "Species1"
        1: "Species2"
        2: "Species3"
        3: "Species4"
        4: "Species5"
        5: "Species6"
        6: "Species7"
        7: "Species8"

Final Test Accuracy = 85.4%

## Time Series Classification

In this second challenge we were asked to correctly classify samples in the multivariate time series format. Since this is a classification problem, the objective was to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels.

Dataset Details:

    Time series shape: 2429x36x6
    File format: .npy
    Number of classes: 12
    Classes:
        0: "Wish"
        1: "Another"
        2: "Comfortably"
        3: "Money"
        4: "Breathe"
        5: "Time"
        6: "Brain"
        7: "Echoes"
        8: "Wearing"
        9: "Sorrow"
        10: "Hey"
        11: "Shine"

Final Test Accuracy = 71.2%
